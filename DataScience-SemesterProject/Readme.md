# ASL Recognition Using Deep Learning

## Project Description

Our goal is to build a model for correctly identifying letters from a dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) images.

American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

In this project, you will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, you will train the network, test its performance and then deploy the model to the web using flask.
